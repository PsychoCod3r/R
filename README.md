**Introduction:**

This is a repository of various data analysis scripts I've written
in R. These are scripts that I've used to analyze data curated from
WordPress Analytics and Twitter Analytics.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why did I make this repository?**

Like the SVG repo, this repo is not devoted to a specific project. I
thought I'd just have one repo for all my R scripts so I could show off
my skills in that language, because honestly large-scale projects in R
aren't really a thing.

**Files included in this repository:**

- README.md - this file

- LICENSE.md - the Michael Warren Free Software License under which all
  my code is released

- regression.r - A script I wrote to plot various metrics for my
  WordPress site over several months and perform linear regressions
  on these metrics

- tweet-engagement.r - An script I wrote to process data collected from
  my Twitter analytics to tell me which tweets I posted got me the most
  attention and traction

**Installation and usage instructions:**

1. Clone this repository.

2. Get data from WordPress Analytics and Twitter Analytics if you have
   accounts on those sites by exporting the data as CSV.
